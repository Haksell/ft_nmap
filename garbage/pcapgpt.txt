With the pcap functions available, another approach is to ensure that your packet processing is as efficient as possible to minimize the risk of buffer overflow and packet drops.

Dispatch Packets Quickly: Use pcap_dispatch() effectively to process packets as quickly as they are captured.
The faster you can process packets, the less likely you are to encounter buffer overflow issues.

Filtering: Use pcap_compile() and pcap_setfilter() to apply a filter that limits the captured traffic to only
what's necessary for your scanning task. By reducing the amount of unnecessary traffic pcap has to handle, you
can mitigate the impact of not being able to increase the buffer size.
